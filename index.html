            <h2>What does WFP do?</h2>
            <p>
                Put simply, as George Ezra once said.  we ride “Shot Gun”. 
                (You’re going to be humming this while you read, sorry)
                       
                Riding shotgun was used to describe the guard who rode alongside a stagecoach driver, ready to use his shotgun to ward off bandits. In modern use, it refers 
                to the practice of sitting alongside the driver in a moving vehicle. The phrase has been used to mean giving actual or figurative support or aid to someone 
                in a situation.[1] The coining of this phrase dates to 1905 at latest. [SOURCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_shotgun) 
                
                As a Leader you are the stagecoach driver, you control the direction, you control the speed, you are in control of the where, the when, the how and the why.
                    
                However, your focus is and should be on the road ahead. What challenges, obstacles or difficulties are the horses facing? 
                        
                This is where Workforce Planning comes in riding shotgun. We are here to ward off bandits. Well not really, what we do do is. While you're watching the 
                road ahead, we’re looking at what's coming down the track, on your left and on your right. Is there anything coming that will slow us down, knock us off 
                course, or maybe we can see a faster path we can take? We look at what happened, did we manage to cross that last river well? Can we do it better next time, 
                can we do it safer? Can we avoid getting our passengers wet?  
            </p>
